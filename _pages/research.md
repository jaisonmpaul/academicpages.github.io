          Open Initiative for Substainable Smart City Developments

Data is the new fuel. Kochi Metro was inaugurated on 17th June 2017 and there are four assured data streams from its IP enabled CPS modules. They are (1) Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system, (2) Trip Planner mobile application (Kochi 1 App), (3) CCTV cameras and (4) Automated Vehicle Location data. Moreover, there are two other external data streams which will complement the above data streams. They are (5) vehicle parking data associated with metro stations and (6) GPS data from the feeder city bus network, both are available to KMRL and thus made available to this project. This data, some of which are structured and the other unstructured, will be put together to create real-time (and near-real-time) information and valuable legacy insights to improve customer experience, customer trip planning, trip scheduling, ridership forecasting, commuter behaviour analysis, security and administration of a metro rail system. Details of these use cases are explained in the main body of the proposal.

### Middleware

The project proposes to develop a CPS data middleware built on the top of customized HDFS based software stack. The very basis of this middleware will be Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which is an industry standard for big data platforms. Data will be stored in HDFS and will be analyzed using MapReduce programs. In order to process streaming and real-time data, the project proposes a combination of Spark, Flume and Kafka big data tools. Machine learning and pattern matching algorithms will be run on the top of this middleware using Google TensorFlow, OpenCV and Spark MLlib.
